Inside here you will find all the files required to run the machine learning app.

It comes with the prediction results and variable importances of my 7 different models.

It does not however come with any of the models or the pollution data itself.

These can be found in the organisation local drive or under my Google drive.

By loading the relevant rds files you can directly run the application.

Alternatively you can see it hosted on: http://highspeedtwo.shinyapps.io/ml_app/
