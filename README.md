# Data-Science-Accelerator

Hello! Kevin here.

The aim of this project was to analse the air and noise quality data of the HS2 phase 1 route.

1) To use this data you need a depositary with the individual air and noise quality data excel files. This can be found here:

https://data.gov.uk/dataset/24542ae7-dd44-444f-b259-871c4cc43b5e/environmental-monitoring-data

I couldn't upload the rds files but you can also find the required data in the organisation g drive as well my google drive.

2) To create the heat map visualisation and do the machine learning you will need to use R. 

3) There is also some code allowing one to link to a SQL server. I mostly used RDS files but reading directly off SQL would allow it to run live.




The individual apps folders contain almost all the information required to actually run each application. 

Alternatively see the links:

See the 'useful_functions' folder for snippets of code that I have produced that could be useful in the future.
