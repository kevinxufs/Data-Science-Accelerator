Here contains all of the different scripts I used to process my data into something usable for my heat map and machine
learning applications.

It does not contain any of the actual data sources. I have uploaded those to my organisation local drive as well as my 
Google drive.

If one is interested only in the applications themselves, I highly recommend just looking at those relevant folders.
They contain (nearly) all the code required to run the apps without any of the processing.
